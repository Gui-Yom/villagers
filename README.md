# villagers

Experiments around a performant system for multi agent pathfinding, task planning and behavior.

### Run
```shell
$ ./gradlew :gui:run
```

### Visualization controls
 - Draw walls with `left click`
 - Clear walls with `right click`
 - `r` to reset the simulation
 - `d` to switch between diagonal and normal 4-way movement
 - `e` to switch between heuristics
 - `s` to change step speed
 - `mouse wheel` to change heuristic weight

Swap between step and normal mode is only supported at compilation atm.
